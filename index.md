## About Me

👏Thank You for visiting my website👏 My name is Sangwoo Park, and I am currently an undergraduate student at Yonsei University, majoring in computer science. I am planning on to become Machine Learning Engineer/ AI researcher. My research interests are reinforcement learning, multimodal learning, and generative AIs. In particular, I am interested in coherent agent decision making in various domains.

## Experience
- Yonsei University DLI Lab NLP Group Research Internship **[Jul. 2023 ~ Jul. 2024]**
    - Participated in NLP Medical AI project to enhance diagnosis of Alzheimer disease, using CoT prompting on Large Language Models to collect filtered diagnostic
    data later distilled to smaller language models securing both stability and efficiency.
    - Major participant in research project aiming to build a framework that can enhance the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models as decision making agents in real-world website environment, without use of reinforcement learning, reducing the need of heavy computing resources.
